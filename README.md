# program.js
A comprehensive and lightweight npm package of common data structures and algorithms to accelerate development.

## About
Why is this module named program.js? An inspiration for this project was computer science pionner Niklaus Wirth: author of the classic textbook *Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs*. We believe that the philosphy of algorithms and data structures being at the core of software is important, so this module is made in the textbook's honor.
