# program.js
A comprehensive and lightweight npm package of common data structures and algorithms to accelerate development.

## About
Why is this module named program.js? An inspiration for this project was computer science pionner Niklaus Wirth: author of the classic textbook *Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs*. The philosphy of algorithms and data structures being at the core of software is important and so we made this module in the textbook's honor.
