# program.js
A comprehensive and lightweight npm package of common data structures and algorithms to accelerate development.

## About
Why is this module named program.js? An inspiration for this project was computer science pionner Niklaus Wirth: author of the classic textbook *Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs*. We believe that the philosphy of algorithms and data structures being at the core of software is important, so this module is made in the textbook's honor.

## Usage
1. Install the package using `npm install --save programjs` or `yarn add programjs`
2. Import the feature set you would like to use (e.g. `import { algorithms } from 'programjs'`)
3. Access specific implementation through the feature set object (e.g. `const sorted_array = algorithms.bubble_sort(array)`)
