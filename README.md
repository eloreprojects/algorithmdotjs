# program.js
A comprehensive npm package of common data structures and algorithms.

## About
Why is this module named program.js? An inspiration for this project was computer science pionner Niklaus Wirth: author of the classic textbook *Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs*. The philosphy of algorithms and data structures being at the core of software is important, which is why we made this module in the textbook's honor.
